Among these festivals, some are religious, some are based on the seasons and some are of national importance. Each and every festival is celebrated uniquely in different ways according to the various rituals and beliefs. Each festival has its own history, legend and significance of the celebration.

Festivals teach us how to fight evil and falsehood and establish the truth. The festivals are marked by fervour, hope, and prayers for a better tomorrow.
